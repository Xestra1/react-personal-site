    - Open github desktop and commit to master then push to origin
    - After that open a command prompt 
    - Navigate to the repo using `cd FILENAME` (If you need help then message me on discord)
    - Once you get the file type `npm start`
        - Make sure everything is good then move onto the next step
    - Press `ctrl+D` to end the localhost
    - After that use zeit.co by typing `now` into the command prompt
    - If you want to use a domain then I suggest getting a .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, or .gq domains (which is free) and using zeit.co to link it to the website
        - Or if you don't want to go through the work then you can just use zeit.co's subdomains
